Key, Terms	Definition
Conventional Area,	Any area that does not require the sale of reformulated gasoline. All types of finished motor gasoline may be sold in this area.
Conventional Gasoline,	Finished motor gasoline not included in the reformulated gasoline category. Excludes reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending (RBOB) as well as other blendstock. Note: this survey designates all motor gasoline collected within a conventional area as conventional gasoline (see conventional area).
Gasoline Grades,	The classification of gasoline by octane ratings. Each type of gasoline (conventional and reformulated) is classified by three grades - regular; midgrade; and premium. Note: gasoline sales are reported by grade in accordance with their classification at the time of sale. In general; automotive octane requirements are lower at high altitudes. Therefore; in some areas of the United States; such as the Rocky Mountain State; the octane ratings for the gasoline grades may be 2 or more octane points lower.
Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel,	Diesel fuel containing more than 15 but less than 500 parts per million (ppm) sulfur.
Midgrade Gasoline,	Gasoline having an antiknock index; i.e.; octane rating; greater than or equal to 88 and less than or equal to 90. Note: Octane requirements may vary by altitude.
Nonattainment Area,	Any area that does not meet the national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard established by the Environmental Protection Agency for designated pollutants; such as carbon monoxide and ozone.
On-Highway Diesel,	Includes sales for use in motor vehicles. For purposes of this survey; it is designed to estimate the retail cash price of self-serve; motor vehicle diesel fuel.
OPRG,	"Oxygenated Fuels Program Reformulated Gasoline" is reformulated gasoline which is intended for use in an oxygenated fuels program control area during an oxygenated fuels program control period.

Premium Gasoline,	Gasoline having an antiknock index; i.e.; octane rating; greater than 90. Note: Octane requirements may vary by altitude.
Reformulated Area,	An ozone nonattainment area designated by the Environmental Protection Agency which requires the use of reformulated gasoline. Includes oxygenated fuels program reformulated gasoline (OPRG).
Reformulated Gasoline,	Finished motor gasoline formulated for use in motor vehicles; the composition and properties of which meet the requirements of the reformulated gasoline regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under Section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act. (Details on this clean fuel program). This category includes oxygenated fuels program reformulated gasoline (OPRG) but excludes reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending (RBOB). Note: this survey designates all motor gasoline collected within a reformulated area as reformulated gasoline (see reformulated area).
Regular Gasoline,	Gasoline having an antiknock index (average of the research octane rating and the motor octane number) greater than or equal to 85 and less than 88. Note: Octane requirements may vary by altitude.
Total Gasoline,	Includes all finished motor gasoline grades (regular; midgrade; premium) and formulations (conventional; reformulated).
Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel,	Diesel fuel containing a maximum 15 parts per million (ppm) sulfur.
